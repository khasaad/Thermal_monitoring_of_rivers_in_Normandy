<h2> Thermal monitoring of rivers in Normandie - France </h2>

<h3>This project is part of data science using data from https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/suivi-thermique-des-riveres-en-normandie/</h3>
<h3> To run the python code, the two existing csv files must be attached. Each time during code execution, new files will be created for later use in this project. </h3>

<p> La Touques, l'Orne and La Sélune were equipped by the Normandy DREAL with thermal monitoring in June 2011. This monitoring was implemented to deepen the overall knowledge of the Normandy fluvial ecosystems and to understand the impact of groundwater tables and dams in Normandy Switzerland on the thermal regimes of the two instrumented rivers.</p>

<p> The probes are attached to the roots of riparian trees, in a shaded position. They are installed at a depth that guarantees their complete immersion whatever the season. The temperature is measured every two hours. The probes used are HOBO® water Temp Pro v2 (U22-001). Their accuracy is +/- 0.2 ° C. Data can be read through two interfaces: optical and USB.</p>


<p>DREAL Normandie provides 2 raw data files:</p>
<ul>
<li>a file on the measurement network with the geographical coordinates of the stations</li>
<li>a file compiling the recorded measurements</li>
</ul>
